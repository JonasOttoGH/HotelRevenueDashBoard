# HotelRevenueDashBoard
Another portfolio project looking at a hotel financial dataset and creating an interactive dashboard. Unfortunately, important data such as the hotel names/chains are missing in the downloaded data set.

This is another project that was done through processing data through Microsoft SQL. Later using Tableau to display the visualisation of the data.

Ask: Questions to Analyse:
- Do resorts or city hotels finically perform better?
- When would be the best time to advertise promotions and launch a sale initiative?

Prepare:
- Data was downloaded from Kaggle.com as 5 different CVC files
- Data was then imported into Microsoft SQL Server (please refer to script)

Process:
- Data was processed using Microsoft SQL Server (please refer to script)
- Data was put into a table using UNION
- Important and relevant data was extracted from the table for visualisation

Analyse/Share: 
- Finally, an interactive visualisation dashboard was made using Tableau.

ACT:

Do resorts or city hotels finically perform better?
- City hotels currently in 2020 generate more revenue and people than resorts. However, in 2018 more this was not the case as resorts generated a higher income. This could be due to COVID19 and that city hotels were easier accessible due to travel restrictions. Resorts have consistently had longer stay times than city hotels over all 3 years running.

- When would be the best time to advertise promotions and launch a sale initiative?
- If a marketing campaign were to be done then I would recommend that this is to be done before the summer months (northern hemisphere) of the calendar year as this is when the hotels gather the most amount of customers. As September seems to be the peak season on average advertising a few months before hand seems like the best idea.
